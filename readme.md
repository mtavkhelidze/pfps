### Chapter 01: Best Practices

Anti-Patters

* Thou shalt not use 'Seq' in your interface.
* Thou shalt not use 'Monad Transformers' in your interface.
* Use `NoStackTrace` instead of `Exception` for custom error ADTs.
* hou shalt not use the 'ifM' extension method.

### Chapter 02: Tagless Final

* Tagless algebras should not have typeclass constraints

> If you find yourself needing to add a typeclass constraint, such as Monad, to
> your algebra, what you probably need is a program. The reason being that
> typeclass constraints define capabilities, which belong in programs and
> interpreters. Algebras should remain completely abstract.

* Programs can make use of algebras and other programs

> Tagless final is all about algebras and interpreters. Yet, something is >
> missing when it comes to writing applications:
> we need to use these algebras > to describe business logic, and this logic
> belongs in what I like to call > programs.

#### Pure business logic

* Combine pure computations in terms of tagless algebras and programs.
* Perform logging (or console stuï¬€) only via a tagless algebra.
